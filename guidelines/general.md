## Markdown

  - When using standard markdown usecases, as is standard, capital letters should be used (as in the following examples)
`CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIB.md`, `LICENSE`, note LICENSE does not have a `.md` extension, it should be plain text.  These can/should be placed in the root directory of your repo.
  - To prevent cluttering the root namespace in repos, any "non-standard" documentation should be placed in a `docs` folder off the root.
  - When using a "non-standard" name, camelcase filenames should be used e.g. `docs/myAdditionalDocumentation.md`.
