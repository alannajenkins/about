# Pull Request Checklist

This checklist is designed to be a simple set of things to think about when reviewing another developers code.

* Do you understand the problem that the code is there to solve?
* At a glance, is the code in a logical structure that is easy to follow (comments, code blocks etc)?
* Has the developer updated the relevant documentation & changelog?
* Are there tests that cover this work, have the tests changed & did the outcome pass?
* Can you leave the developer with any learnings from this interaction, can it be documented / blog posted?
